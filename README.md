puppet-pdns
===============

This is an PowerDNS module for Puppet. It currently supports RedHat-based operating system families, but is built to provide a simple framework for other platforms.  Similarly, the only backend currently supported is LDAP. But, again, this is factored such that adding additional backends should be a trivial task.
